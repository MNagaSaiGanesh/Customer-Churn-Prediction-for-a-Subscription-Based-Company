Data Collection:

Gather historical customer data, including demographics, subscription details, customer interactions, and usage patterns.
Collect labels for customers who have churned or stayed.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
Standardize data formats and encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Normalize or scale numerical features to improve model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize customer behavior using histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.
Identify key features correlated with churn, such as payment delays, service complaints, or decreasing usage.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features such as average monthly usage, time since last customer support interaction, and customer lifetime value.
Select important features using statistical methods or techniques like feature importance from a tree-based model.
Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Train several machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) to predict churn.
Use hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search or random search) to optimize model performance.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
Select the model that provides the best balance between sensitivity (recall) and precision to minimize false negatives.
Deployment:

Deploy the model as an API for integration with the company’s CRM system.
Build a simple dashboard to display churn predictions and risk scores for individual customers.
Actionable Insights:

Segment customers based on churn risk and provide recommendations for targeted interventions, such as personalized offers or improved customer service.
Monitor the model’s performance over time and retrain it with new data to maintain accuracy.
